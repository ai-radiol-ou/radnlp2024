A lobulated tumor mass with a diameter of 40 mm is present in segment S6 of the right lower lobe of the lung, suspicious of lung cancer. A ground-glass nodule with lobulated margins is present in segment S2 of the right upper lobe, which may also be lung cancer (adenocarcinoma in situ).
Emphysematous changes in the lung. No metastases or other lesions in the lungs.
The right upper paratracheal lymph node is enlarged, suggesting metastasis. Enlarged lymph nodes are also suspected at the right hilum.
A small amount of pleural effusion is present.
Multiple hypodense tumors are found in the liver. Gallstones and common bile duct stones are found, and the intrahepatic bile ducts and the common bile duct are dilated. There are no CT findings suggesting biliary tumors such as thickening of the bile duct wall, and liver metastasis from lung cancer is more likely.
Multiple enlarged lymph nodes at the hepatic hilum, which also suggests the possibility of metastasis.
There are no obvious abnormalities in the pancreas, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, or pelvic organs.
Ascites is present.
