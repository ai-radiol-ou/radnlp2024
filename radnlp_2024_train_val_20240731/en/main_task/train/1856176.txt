A tumor with a major axis of 1 cm, which obstructs the airways from the right main bronchus to the lower lobe bronchus, is observed at the right hilum, suspecting known lung cancer. Possible fusion of the mass with right hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes. 
Atelectasis of the right lower lobe. There is a possibility that lung cancer may also be present here, but it is not conclusively assessable.
Pleural effusion in the right chest.
Ground-glass opacities in both lungs, suggesting pulmonary edema.
