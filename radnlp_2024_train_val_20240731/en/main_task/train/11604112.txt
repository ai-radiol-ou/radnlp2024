Emphysematous changes of the lung parenchyma.
An irregular mass is located in the apex of the right lung, which is considered to be a known cancer lesion. Its longest diameter is 46 mm. It is widely in contact with the pleura, suggesting invasion. However, clear invasion into the chest wall cannot be pointed out. 
No lesions suspicious of lung metastasis. 
Pathological enlargement of the lymph nodes near the trachea, suspicious of metastases. No pathological enlargement in the supraclavicular lymph nodes. 
No pleural effusion. 
A coarse tumor is seen in the left adrenal gland, suspecting metastasis. 
No significant abnormal findings in other visualized upper abdominal organs. 
No bone destruction or bone sclerosis suggesting metastasis in the visualized bones.
