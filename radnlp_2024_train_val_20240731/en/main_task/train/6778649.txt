A tumor is present in the left pulmonary hilum, suggesting lung cancer. The right upper lobe bronchus is obstructed due to tumor infiltration, resulting in atelectasis of the left upper lobe. The border between the tumor and the atelectasis is difficult to evaluate. The left pulmonary artery is in contact with the tumor and is narrowed. Infiltration is suspected. Enlarged lymph nodes are observed in the left pulmonary hilum and mediastinum, suggesting metastasis. Enlarged lymph nodes are also prominent in the right pulmonary hilum, possibly metastasis. No findings suggest secondary tumor nodules in the lungs. Small left pleural effusion. No obvious abnormalities in the visualized upper abdomen.
