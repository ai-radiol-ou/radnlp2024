A tumor that has become a conglomerate with the hilar lymph nodes is seen on the central side of the left upper lobe. The left upper lobe bronchus is obstructed, and atelectasis is present, making it difficult to measure the size of the tumor. The tumor protrudes into the mediastinum, suggesting mediastinal invasion.
There is enlargement of the mediastinal lymph nodes on the same side, suspicious of metastasis.
A small amount of pleural effusion on the left, which might be malignant pleural effusion.
