A mass, approximately 12 cm in diameter, is observed primarily in the upper lobe of the left lung, extending across the interlobar pleura to the lower lobe of the left lung. The tumor is widely in contact with the mediastinum and pleura. Osteolytic changes are observed in the left third rib, suggesting infiltration. Enlarged lymph nodes are observed in the left hilum and near the aorta, suspicious of metastasis. Several nodules of a few millimeters are observed in the upper lobe of the left lung, possibly metastasis. No lesions suspicious of metastasis in other lung fields. There is no pleural effusion. No lesions suspicious of bone metastasis.
