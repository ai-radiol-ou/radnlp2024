A solid tumor-like lesion of approximately 72 mm is located in the center of the left lung's lower lobe, S10. Primary lung cancer is suspected. It is in contact with the pleura, and pleural invasion is suspected. Pleural effusion and pleural thickening are noted, suspecting pleural dissemination.
There are nodules in the upper lobe of the left lung, suspicious of intra-lobe metastasis on the same side.
Numerous enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla, suspicious of distant lymph node metastases.
Osteolytic lesions in the left scapula and humerus, forming tumor-like masses, suggesting bone metastases.
A nodule is observed in the mid-dorsal subcutaneous area, which is cystic, and a sebaceous cyst is suspected here.
