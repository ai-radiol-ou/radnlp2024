In the coronary reconstruction images, mixed ground-glass opacity (GGO) is observed in the right lower lobe of the lung, considered to be the known lung cancer. The solid part is 3 cm in diameter, which is considered T1c.
A ground-glass nodule is also seen in the apex of the left lung. Although small, it is nearly fully rounded and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma cannot be ruled out. Please confirm histologically if there is an increase in size in follow-up.
No mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement.
No pleural effusion.
No significant findings in the visualized abdominal organs.
