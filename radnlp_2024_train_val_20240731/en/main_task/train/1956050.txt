Emphysematous changes.
A mass is observed in the center of the left upper lobe. The left upper lobe bronchus is interrupted proximally, and irregularity and narrowing are observed in the left pulmonary artery and vein, which are partially interrupted. The mass corresponds to the known lung cancer.
The left upper lobe is collapsed and the exact tumor size is not assessable conclusively, but the long diameter is considered to be slightly over 7 cm. 
A spindle-shaped small nodule is observed in the right lower lobe, likely an inflammatory scar.
No signs of lung metastases.
Enlarged lymph nodes are observed in the left hilum and on the left side of the aortic arch. The latter is 9 mm in short diameter, nearly spherical, suspicious of metastasis. 
No pleural effusion. 
No lesions suspected of metastasis in the visualized liver and adrenal glands.
