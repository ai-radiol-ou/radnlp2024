Plaques with some coarse calcification are scattered on both pleurae, suggesting asbestos-related pleural disease. Mild emphysematous changes of the lung parenchyma. Ground-glass opacities and reticular opacities are seen in the peripheral lung parenchyma, predominantly in the lower lobes on both sides, suggesting interstitial pneumonia. An irregular nodule is present on the pleura of the right lower lobe, with a long diameter of 12 mm, which is considered to be the indicated cancer lesion. No pleural invasion. No lesions suggesting lung metastasis. There is no pathological enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, or the supraclavicular lymph nodes. No pleural effusion. No metastasis in the visualized liver and adrenal glands. Gallstones. No signs of cholecystitis. No bone destruction or sclerotic lesions suggesting bone metastasis.
