A 50 mm tumor is located in the apex of the right lung, in contact with the pleura. The tumor has irregular margins and spiculated appearance. Osteolytic lesions are observed in the right second rib in contact with the tumor, suggesting infiltration. These findings strongly suggest lung cancer. Emphysematous changes are observed in the lung parenchyma. Ground glass opacities and reticular opacities are present in the peripheral lung parenchyma, suggesting emphysema complicated by interstitial pneumonia. No findings suggestive of metastasis in the lungs. Numerous mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilar region, which are considered to be reactive enlargement. There is no pathological enlargement. No pleural effusion. Diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland. Please evaluate thyroid function. There seems to be a tumor in the left adrenal gland, but it's only partially visualized and difficult to evaluate. Due to the lack of native CT images, it is also difficult to evaluate density values and contrast enhancement. There is a possibility of metastasis, so further detailed examination with MRI or PET is recommended. No significant abnormal findings in the visualized upper abdomen. No bone destruction or sclerotic lesions in the visualized bones.
