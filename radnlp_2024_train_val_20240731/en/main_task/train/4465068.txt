No comparable imaging studies are available.
There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes with heterogeneous enhancement in the right hilum and mediastinum. S/P resection of right breast cancer, but there is no significant lymph node enlargement in other areas, suggesting lymph node metastasis of small cell lung cancer.
Nodules of about 1 cm in the right upper lobe and 5 mm in the right lower lobe. Although there is a possibility of primary or metastatic lesions, the polygonal shape suggests benign lesions such as old granulomas.
Interstitial changes such as ground-glass opacities, reticular opacities, and cystic changes are seen on the dorsal side of both lower lobes.
No other obvious active lesions in the lung field.
Postoperative changes in the right breast. No obvious tumors or abnormal enhancement at the resection site or in the left breast.
There is no pleural effusion.
A hypodense lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Correlation with ultrasound recommended.
No obvious abnormalities in the visualized upper abdomen.
There is no ascites.
No other significant findings.
