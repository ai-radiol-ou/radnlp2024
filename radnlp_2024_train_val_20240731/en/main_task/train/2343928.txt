No comparable imaging studies available. A lobulated tumor mass, approximately 47 mm in diameter, in the hilum of the left upper lobe, which is considered to be a known finding of lung cancer. The lesion appears to surround the bronchus of the left upper lobe, suggesting bronchial stenosis. Expansion into the mediastinum is also suspected, and the boundary with the left main pulmonary artery cannot be assessed conclusively on the current CT. Please consider evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT. 
No significant lymph node enlargement in the mediastinum or hilum. 
No pleural effusion. 
No obvious abnormalities in the visualized upper abdomen.
