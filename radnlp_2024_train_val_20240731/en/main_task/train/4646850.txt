Pulmonary emphysematous changes. 
There is an irregularly margined mass in the lower lobe of the left lung, approximately 35 mm in diameter, considered to be the known lung cancer. 
Apart from this tumor, a nodule of 8 mm in diameter is present in the left lower lobe, suspicious of metastasis. 
No other lesions suggesting lung metastasis. 
Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the left hilum, suspicious of metastasis. 
No pathological enlargement of lymph nodes in the mediastinum or supraclavicular fossa. 
No pleural effusion is present. 
In the liver, two hypovascular tumors with ill-defined margins are observed in the gallbladder bed, suspicious of metastasis. 
These tumors are in contact with the gallbladder, and diffuse wall thickening is observed in the gallbladder. Therefore, infiltration into the gallbladder is considered. 
No lesions suggestive of adrenal metastasis. 
Bilateral renal cysts. 
No significant abnormal findings in other abdominal organs. 
No pathological enlargement of abdominal lymph nodes. 
No ascites is present. 
No bone destruction or sclerotic lesions suggestive of bone metastasis.
