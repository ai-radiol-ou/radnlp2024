A tumor with a diameter of 12 cm is observed spreading across the upper and lower lobe of the left lung, corresponding to known lung cancer. It is in extensive contact with the pleura and is accompanied by the destruction of the left 3rd rib. Rib and parietal pleural infiltration is suspected. There are small nodules in the left upper lobe, suspicious of secondary tumor nodules. The left mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes are enlarged, suspicious of metastasis. No pleural effusion. No obvious abnormalities are observed in the visualized upper abdomen.
