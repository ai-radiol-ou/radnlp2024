There is a 50 mm neoplastic lesion with spiculated margins in the right lung apex. It is widely in contact with the pleura, and pleural invasion is suspected. There is no invasion to the ribs. Both lungs have subpleural reticular opacities and ground-glass opacities, suggesting interstitial pneumonia. No lung metastasis. No pleural effusion. No liver or adrenal metastasis.
