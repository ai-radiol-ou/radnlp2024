A lobulated tumor mass, approximately 30 mm in diameter is present in S6 of the left lower lobe of the lung. This is considered lung adenocarcinoma. A nodule of about 9 mm in diameter is in contact with the lesion, and a nodule of 8 mm in contact with the interlobar pleura is also seen within the same lobe, considered to be secondary tumor nodules. 
No findings suggesting metastasis in other lobes of the lung. 
Bullae are present in both lung apices. 
Enlargement of the left hilar lymph nodes, suspicious of metastasis. No significant lymph node enlargement in other areas.
