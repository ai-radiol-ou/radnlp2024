A nodule is present in the right hilum to the right bronchus (the nodular part is approximately 17 mm). Primary bronchial carcinoma (adenosquamous carcinoma) originating from the right hilum bronchus is suspected. The ventilation of the right lower and middle lobes is decreased, and air bronchograms and mucus plugs are also observed, considered to be an obstructive atelectasis of the right lower and middle lobes due to bronchial carcinoma. The ventilation of the right upper lobe is normal.
No obvious nodules in the left lung.
The right hilar lymph nodes are conglomerated, and lymph node metastasis is suspected. The mediastinal lymph nodes are also enlarged, suggesting metastasis.
