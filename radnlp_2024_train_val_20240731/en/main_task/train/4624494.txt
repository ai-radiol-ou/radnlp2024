There is an irregular mass with a diameter of 50 mm in the apex of the right lung. It appears to protrude into the subpleural adipose tissue near the origin of the right second rib, and pleural invasion on the visceral side may be present. The right hilum and mediastinal lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but not of significant size. Emphysematous changes in the lungs. There are subpleural ground-glass and reticular opacities, which are considered to be interstitial changes. No pleural effusion.
