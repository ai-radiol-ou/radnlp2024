A mass of approximately 74 mm is observed in the upper lobe of the left lung, not containing any air. Primary lung cancer is suspected. The central bronchus is obstructed by the tumor, leaving the upper lobe of the left lung in an almost completely atelectatic state. 
No pulmonary nodules. There are no findings suggesting lung metastasis.
Infiltration into the left hilar lymph nodes is suspected. There is no mediastinal lymph node enlargement.
No distant metastasis visualized.
