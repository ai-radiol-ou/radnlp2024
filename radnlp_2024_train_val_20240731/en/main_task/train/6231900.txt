A tumor-like lesion with irregular margins, measuring up to 72 mm in diameter, is present on the mediastinal side of the left lower lobe of the lung. The lesion shows heterogenous contrast enhancement. It is considered to correlate to the known cancer. The tumor is widely in contact with the pleura, but without clear mediastinal invasion. The left lower lobe bronchus is severely narrowed or occluded, and ground-glass opacities and infiltrative consolidations suggesting obstructive pneumonia are observed around the tumor. Also, thickening of the interlobular septa is seen around the tumor, possibly lymphangitic carcinomatosis. No lesions suspicious of metastasis to other lobes of the lung. There are numerous rounded enlarged peritracheal and axillary lymph nodes on the left, suggestive of metastasis. A small amount of left pleural effusion is present. No metastasis to the visualized liver or adrenal glands. There are osteolytic lesions in the proximal part of the left humerus and the left scapula, considered to be metastases.
