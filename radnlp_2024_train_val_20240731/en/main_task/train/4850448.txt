Mild emphysematous changes of the lungs are present. 
The left upper lobe is atelectatic. An irregular soft tissue mass is located centrally, suggesting the possibility of lung cancer. There is a possibility of infiltration into the mediastinum.
Left hilar lymph nodes are enlarged, suggesting the possibility of metastasis. Enlarged lymph nodes are also suspected in the same side mediastinum, suggesting the possibility of metastasis.
A small amount of left pleural effusion is present.
