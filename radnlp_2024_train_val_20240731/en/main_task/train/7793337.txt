A nodular infiltratative opacity of 30 mm in diameter is present in the right lower lobe S8, corresponding to known lung cancer. It is in extensive contact with the interlobar pleura, suggesting infiltration. No findings suspicious of metastasic nodules are observed in both lungs. Striated opacities are present in both lower lobes, likely inflammatory scarring.
No significant enlargement of the mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes, or other mediastinal organ lesions.
No pleural effusion.
No obvious abnormalities in the visualized upper abdomen.
