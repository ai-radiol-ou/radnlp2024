A tumor mass measuring 50 mm in diameter is located in the right lung apex. The lesion is in close proximity to the pleura and extends close to the ribs. There is a possibility of pleural invasion.
Small nodules are found in the right upper lobe. Their size is too small for a specific diagnosis, please follow up.
Centrilobular emphysema is seen mainly in the upper lungs. Interstitial changes such as ground-glass opacities, reticular opacities, and cystic changes are seen in the peripheral areas of both lower lobes.
No other obvious active lesions are observed in the lungs.
The size of the lymph nodes at the right hilum and below the tracheal bifurcation is noticeable, suggesting the possibility of metastasis. Please also evaluate with PET-CT.
No other significant lymph node enlargement visualized.
No pleural effusion.
A hypodense tumor is found in the left adrenal gland. Detailed evaluation is difficult as it is only partially visualized, but metastasis cannot be ruled out. Please consider additional abdominal CT.
No other obvious abnormalities in the visualized upper abdomen.
No ascites.
No other significant findings.
