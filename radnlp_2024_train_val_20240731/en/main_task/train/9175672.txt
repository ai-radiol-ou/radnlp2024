Enlarged lymph nodes in the right pulmonary hilum and the mediastinum, raising suspicion for lung cancer. Small lymph nodes can also be seen in the left mediastinum, but their size is not significant. 
There is a nodule in the right upper lobe, considered to be a secondary tumor nodule within the same lobe.
Ground-glass opacities and reticular opacities are distributed mainly in the lower lung and subpleural area on the right, consistent with interstitial pneumonia. 
No pleural effusion.
The patient has a history of right breast cancer treatment. No obvious local recurrence or axillary lymph node enlargement.
The left adrenal gland is enlarged with an obvious tumor mass, but please follow up to rule out metastasis.
No obvious metastasis in the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, or kidneys.
