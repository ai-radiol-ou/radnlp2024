Severe emphysematous changes. There is an irregular tumor of 47 mm in the upper lobe of the left lung, suspecting lung cancer. The tumor has narrowed the upper lobe bronchus. Also, the tumor is closely associated with the main trunk of the left pulmonary artery, raising suspicion of invasion. Please re-evaluate in contrast-enhanced imaging. The tumor is also in contact with the mediastinum near the aortic arch, and evaluation of mediastinal invasion by contrast-enhanced images is recommended. The tumor appears to be a mass with the left hilum lymph nodes. No coarse mediastinal lymphadenopathy. No pleural effusion.
