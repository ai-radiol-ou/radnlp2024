Emphysematous changes of the lung parenchyma.
A tumor with a diameter of 40 mm is located in the lower lobe of the right lung. It has a lobulated shape, and lung cancer is strongly suspected. There are multiple granular opacities and mucus plugs in the periphery, which are considered to be signs of obstructive pneumonia. 
Ground-glass opacities in both upper lobes of the lungs. Small nodules are scattered along the pleura of the left lung. Both are suspected to be post-inflammatory changes. 
No lesions suggestive of lung metastasis.
Multiple rounded lymph nodes in the upper mediastinum without pathological enlargment, but likely to be metastases. 
No pleural effusion. 
A faint hyperdense stone with a diameter of 13 mm is observed in the lower part of the common bile duct. The upstream bile duct is dilated, which is considered to be due to stone impaction. 
Numerous gallstones. The gallbladder is enlarged and its wall is thickened, possibly with accompanying inflammation.
Multiple poorly defined hypodense tumors in the liver, primarily suspicious of metastes, but coexistence of liver abscesses is also considered.
Multiple enlarged, nearly round lymph nodes in the porta hepatis, possibly metastases.
No pathological enlargement of other abdominal lymph nodes. 
No lesions suggestive of adrenal metastasis.
There is a cyst in the left kidney. 
No significant abnormalities in the pancreas and spleen. 
No obvious tumors in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Ascites. 
No bone destruction or sclerotic lesions strongly suggestive of metastasis in the visualized bones.
