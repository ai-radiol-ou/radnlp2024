There is a tumor with a major axis of 72 mm in the left lower lobe, suspicious of lung cancer. The tumor protrudes into the mediastinum and is in contact with the descending thoracic aorta, suggesting mediastinal invasion. There is interstitial thickening around the tumor, possibly carcinomatous lymphangitis.
There is lymph node enlargement below the tracheal bifurcation, metastasis cannot be ruled out. In addition, multiple left axillary lymph nodes are enlarged, suspicious of metastasis.
There is tumor formation in the head of the left humerus and in the scapula, suggesting bone metastasis.
