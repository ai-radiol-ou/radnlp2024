Emphysema and interstitial changes in both lungs. Thickening and calcification of the pleura on both sides. Asbestosis seems to be present.
An irregular subpleural nodule is found in the right lung in S9 (approximately 12 mm), possibly primary lung cancer associated with asbestosis.
Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, but considering the size of the lung cancer, lymph node hyperplasia related to asbestosis or chronic inflammation is more likely.
