Moderate emphysematous changes in the lungs.
An irregularly margined tumor is observed in the central part of the left upper lung lobe. The margins are spiculated and the tumor has a maximum diameter of 47 mm. It is considered to be the known lung cancer. The tumor is  in broad contact with the interlobar pleura.
The left pulmonary artery upper lobe branch is in broad contact with the tumor, and infiltration is suspected.
The left upper lobe bronchus is compressed and narrowed by the tumor.
There are scattered tiny nodules in both lung fields. Due to their small size, differentiation is difficult. Many are rectangular, and are mostly considered benign lesions, but it is possible that some of them are metastases.
No pathological enlargement in the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.
No pleural effusion.
No gross lesions in the visualized upper abdomen, as far as can be assessed by CT.
No bone destruction or bone sclerosis suggesting metastasis visualized.
