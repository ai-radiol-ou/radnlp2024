A dense ground-glass opacity measuring 30 mm in diameter is located in S8 of the right lower lung lobe. It is somewhat indistinct and partially lobulated. It is considered to be consistent with a cancerous lesion. No clear pleural invasion.
Multiple ground-glass opacities of several millimeters in both upper lung lobes, possibly pre-cancerous lesions, recommended for follow-up.
No lesions suggestive of lung metastasis.
A cord-like opacity is observed in the left lower lung lobe, considered to be a finding of old inflammatory changes.
No pathological enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.
No pleural effusion.
No significant abnormalities in the visualized upper abdomen.
No bone destruction or sclerotic lesions suggestive of metastasis in the visualized bones.
