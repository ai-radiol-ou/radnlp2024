No comparable imaging studies are available. A lobulated tumor mass, approximately 30 mm in diameter, is present in S8 of the right lower lobe of the lung, accompanied by a slight ground-glass opacity in its periphery. This is considered to be a finding of known lung cancer. Multiple pure GGNs up to about 10 mm are found in the upper and lingular segments of the left lung, which can't be ruled out as neoplastic lesions such as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH). There are no obvious metastases or other active lesions in the lungs. There is no significant lymph node enlargement in the mediastinum or hilum. There is no pleural effusion. There are no obvious abnormalities in the visualized upper abdomen. No ascites. No other significant findings.
