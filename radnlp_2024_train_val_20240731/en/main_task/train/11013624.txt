There is a large 12 cm hypodense tumor in the left upper lobe, considered to be lung cancer. It is widely in contact with the pleura on the mediastinal side, and pleural invasion is suspected. There is no direct invasion to the mediastinum. The left pulmonary hilum and ipsilateral mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged, suspicious of metases. The left third rib is directly invaded by the tumor. No pleural effusion. No adrenal metastasis.
