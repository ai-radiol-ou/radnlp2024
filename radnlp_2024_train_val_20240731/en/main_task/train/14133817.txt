Chest:
Emphysematous changes.
A 40 mm tumor is located in the right lower lobe, accompanied by pleural invasion. Lung cancer is suspected. A bronchial mucus plug is suspected below the tumor, but a tumor thrombus cannot be ruled out.
There is a faint ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe, which may be an inflammatory change. Please follow up.
The right hilar lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, suggesting metastases. No enlargement of the mediastinal lymph nodes.
No pleural effusion.
