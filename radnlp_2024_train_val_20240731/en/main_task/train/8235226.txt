Moderate chronic pulmonary emphysema. An irregular tumor with a long diameter of 47 mm is seen in the left upper lobe at the pulmonary hilum, suspicious primary lung cancer. It is in extensive contact with the interlobar pleura, suggesting infiltration. Mediastinal fat infiltration is also suspected. No significant enlargement of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes or other mediastinal organ lesions. No pleural effusion. No obvious abnormalities in the visualized upper abdomen.
