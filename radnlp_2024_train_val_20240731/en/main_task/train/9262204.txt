There is a 12 mm subpleural nodule of the right lower lobe in S9, surrounded by ground-glass opacity. Compared to the CT in August 2012, it has increased in size, and we suspect lung cancer. There are subpleural reticular opacities and ground-glass opacities in both lungs, consistent with interstitial pneumonia. There is a cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe S6, which may be a post-inflammatory change. No pleural effusion. No lymph node enlargement. Gallstones. No other gross abnormalities in the visualized abdominal organs.
