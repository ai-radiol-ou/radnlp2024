A tumor with a diameter of 4.2 cm is present in the right lower lobe, suspicious of lung cancer. Atelectasis is also present. There is contrast-enhancing thickening of the chest wall near the tumor, suggesting infiltration. The tumor is considered T3.
The mediastinal lymph nodes in levels 4R and 7 are enlarged, suspecting metastasis. No pathological enlargement is seen in the lymph nodes on the opposite side, thus it is considered N2.
There is a small amount of pleural effusion on both sides, predominantly on the right, which may be malignant.
No tumorous lesions in the liver and adrenal glands.
A cyst is seen in the left kidney.
No significant findings in the gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen.
Sclerotic bone lesions are found in the left 7th rib, L4, L5, sacrum, and both iliac bones, suspicious of metastasis. As metastases are only in the bone but there are multiple, it is considered M1c.
