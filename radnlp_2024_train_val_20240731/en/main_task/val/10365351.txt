A tumor-like lesion is present in the central parts of the left lung (103 × 83 × 96 mm), suspicious of primary lung cancer. The peripheral areas of the left lung have become atelectatic, causing the border of the tumor to be unclear. 
The tumor is in extensive contact with the mediastinum, suggesting mediastinal invasion. 
Multiple nodules are observed in the right lung, suggesting possible contralateral lung metastasis. 
There is enlargement of the left pulmonary hilar lymph nodes, suggesting lymph node metastases. Enlargement is also observed in the lymph nodes below the tracheal bifurcation with a possibility of mediastinal lymph node metastases.
