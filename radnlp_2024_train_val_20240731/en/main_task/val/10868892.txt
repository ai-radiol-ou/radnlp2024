A 42 mm tumor is located in the right lower lobe, suspecting lung cancer. Discontinuous secondary tumor nodules within the same lobe in S6 are suspected. The mediastinal lymph nodes at the right hilum and on the same side below the tracheal bifurcation are enlarged, suspecting metastasis. Although not significant in size, there is mild enlargement of the contralateral mediastinal lymph nodes, and metastasis cannot be ruled out. A small amount of pleural effusion is present on both sides. On the right side, there are areas where the pleura appears thickened, suspicious of dissemination. Lesions and bone sclerosis are observed in the left 7th rib, 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae, sacrum, and bilateral pelvic bones, suspecting multiple bone metastases. No obvious metastasis in the adrenal glands or liver. A cyst is seen in the left kidney. No enlargement of the para-aortic lymph nodes and no ascites.
