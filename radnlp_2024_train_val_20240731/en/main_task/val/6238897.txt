A soft tissue mass is observed in the left pulmonary hilum, suggesting lung cancer. It has progressed into the mediastinum, and the left main bronchus is obstructed by the tumor, resulting in a collapsed left lung. Nodules are scattered in the right lung, possibly metastases. No significant lymph node enlargement in the opposite pulmonary hilum. Pleural effusion on the left.
