A tumor measuring 37 mm in diameter is present in the left pulmonary hilum, with spiculated margins and an internal cavity. Lung cancer is suspected. The tumor is located in the upper lobe, but it crosses the interlobar pleura and invades the lower lobe as well. There is also a possibility that it is forming a mass with metastasis to the hilar lymph nodes.
Several nodules of a few millimeters in size are scattered in both lungs. Granulomas or intrapulmonary lymph nodes are suspected, but please follow up to rule out metastasis.
No significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy or ascites.
