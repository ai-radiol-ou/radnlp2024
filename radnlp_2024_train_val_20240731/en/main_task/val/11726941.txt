There is an irregularly margined tumor in the left hilum, which is considered to be the indicated cancer lesion. The left main bronchus is obstructed, and the entire left lung has become atelectatic. Due to this, it is difficult to evaluate the size of the tumor, but it appears to be approximately 10 cm or more in the longest dimension. 
The left pulmonary vein is obstructed proximally. The left pulmonary artery shows some irregularity proximally, suggesting infiltration, but no clear obstruction is present. 
Multiple rounded small nodules are observed in the right lung, suspicious of metastases. 
The left hilar lymph nodes have become one mass with the tumor, and subcarinal lymph nodes are enlarged, suspecting metastases. 
Pleural effusion on the left. 
No metastasis in the visualized upper abdomen.
