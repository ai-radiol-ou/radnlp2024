Multiple tumors are observed in both lungs. Particularly from the right upper lobe to the middle lobe, there is a large tumor with chest wall invasion, suspecting lung cancer with multiple lung metastases.
Bilateral pleural effusion, predominantly on the left. Especially on the left side, tumor formation along the pleura is suspected, which is considered to be dissemination.
The mediastinal lymph nodes are slightly enlarged. Metastasis cannot be ruled out.
There are bilateral adrenal nodules, suspecting metastases.
Bilateral hydronephrosis, please perform additional abdominal examination.
