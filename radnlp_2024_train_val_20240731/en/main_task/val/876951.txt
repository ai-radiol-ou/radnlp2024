Tumor with a maximum diameter of 37 mm, mainly on the dorsal side of the left upper lung lobe, protruding into the lower lobe across the interlobar pleura. Spiculated margins and a cavity are present in the mass. The findings are consistent with lung cancer. The tumor is in contact with the left pulmonary artery, but no clear irregularities or narrowing of the vessel wall, indicative of invasion, can be seen. Small nodules scattered along the pleura of both lungs, without pleural effusion, likely benign changes such as inflammatory scars and less likely tumor dissemination. No pathological enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. A smooth-bordered mass, likely a benign lesion such as a sebaceous cyst, in the subcutaneous tissue of the right back. No findings suspicious of metastasis in the visualized upper abdomen.
