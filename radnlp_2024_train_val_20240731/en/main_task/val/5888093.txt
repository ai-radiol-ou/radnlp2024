A tumor with a maximum diameter of 103 mm is present in the left hilum, suggesting primary lung cancer. The left main bronchus shows obstruction due to tumor infiltration. The left lung is collapsed. The tumor also infiltrates the left pulmonary artery, causing it to narrow. Mediastinal tumor infiltration is suspected. The tumor, left hilar, and left mediastinal lymph nodes are all conglomerated. The right mediastinal lymph nodes are also enlarged, suggesting metastasis.
Nodules suspected of being secondary tumor nodules are scattered in the right lung.
Small pleural effusion on the left.
No gross abnormalities in the visualized upper abdomen.
