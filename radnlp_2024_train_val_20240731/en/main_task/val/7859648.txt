There is an irregular tumor mass in the right lower lobe, suggesting a finding of known primary lung cancer (maximum diameter 42 mm). The ipsilateral subcarinal lymph nodes are pathologically enlarged, suggesting metastasis. There are multiple sclerotic lesions in the bone, suggesting metastases. Please confirm with bone scintigraphy or PET.
