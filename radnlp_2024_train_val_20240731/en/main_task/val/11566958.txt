An irregular tumor-like lesion of approximately 3.7 cm is located centrally in S3 of the left upper lung lobe. It is primarily composed of solid components, and also has a cavity inside. There is ground-glass opacity at its periphery, as well as accompanying inflammatory changes in the peripheral lung parenchyma. It is also in contact with the interlobar pleura, and viscearl pleural invasion is suspected. Multiple small nodules are observed in the periphery, suggesting the possibility of intrapulmonary lymphatic involvement.
