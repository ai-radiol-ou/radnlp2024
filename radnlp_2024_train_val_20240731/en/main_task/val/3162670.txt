A tumor forming a mass with the pulmonary hilum and mediastinal lymph nodes in the left pulmonary hilum, suspicious of lung cancer. The left main bronchus is obstructed, and no air is observed in the left lung. There is stenosis in the main trunk of the left pulmonary artery, suggesting infiltration. Also, the tumor is in close contact with the left atrium, suggesting infiltration. Multiple nodules in the right upper and lower lobes, suggesting lung metastasis. Pleural effusion on the left.
