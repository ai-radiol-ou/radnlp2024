There is a 37 mm cavitary lesion with spiculated margins in the posterior left upper lobe. 
The left upper lobe bronchus is obstructed due to the tumor. 
Part of the tumor has infiltrated beyond the interlobar pleura into the left lower lobe. 
The left hilar lymph nodes are conglomerated with the tumor, suggesting lymph node metastasis. 
No pleural effusion. 
There is a cystic lesion in the subcutaneous tissue of the right back, probably a sebaceous cyst.
